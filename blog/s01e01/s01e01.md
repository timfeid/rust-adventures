# From TypeScript Coder to Rust Prodigy: A Meme-Inspired Transformation s01e01

I’m not a writer and honestly I generally hate writing things

## Backstory

![mirc editor](https://github.com/timfeid/rust-adventures/blob/master/blog/s01e01/images/mirc.gif?raw=true)

When I was younger, I started my programming career with the amazing script editor in mIRC. From the first hello world to a working mp3 player, I thought I was a genius! I wish I could remember the big mIRC scripting site so I could find more of my shitty code. It was 2006 and my life consisted of counter strike and scripting from the moment I got home from the most boring classes in 6th grade to the moment I went to bed. My grades were shit because all I was thinking about was getting back home and on the computer.

This eventually led to me creating some bots on the IRC server called SportSurge (or GamesNet)? You know, those ones that could moderate your channel or you could ask for the weather or what was playing on LastFM/audioscrobbler. They were written in everyone's favorite language called PHP. I hope to never find the zip bundle I uploaded of the code base anywhere. I'm almost positive you could do some MySqueel injection on some of the commands.

I have always had this feeling that writing projects was a good way to keep myself from burning out at my day job. I have never stopped writing projects, but I always seem to lose interest in about a month. I had written over 30 side projects in the last 3 years, but I wanted to actually “finish” exactly two of them.

## Memes and Enthusiasm

I was scrolling through the YouTube rabbit hole and I kept seeing the same video on my feed. I had no interest the first 10 times, so why does YouTube keep recommending this shit? Obviously I'm not a new developer, but I guess YouTube didn't know that I was yet. It happened to be a video by ThePrimeagen titled “[How I Would Get My First Job If I Started Over.](https://youtu.be/hW5s_UUO1RI)” The amount of passion, engagement and excitement from him was contagious, inspiring everyone around him to strive for greatness and push beyond their limits (ChatGPT generated the last part of this, I'm lazy).

That's when it dawned on me. I haven't been passionate about my career in over 3 years and I had never really thought about looking at any content related to software development in ages. So after all, maybe it was a good suggestion by YouTube. I checked out a lot more of his videos over the next couple of days and became hooked on his reactions and memes. There was one (jk there were at least five) videos where he would scream Tokio from the top of his lungs.

On the 3rd or 10th “TOKIOOOOOO”, I realized I wanted to be that passionate, and that was the "Aha!" moment. I need to learn Rust and document my progress. So this is where we are now, day one of my blog series, "From TypeScript Coder to Rust Prodigy: A Meme-Inspired Transformation." I wanted to document my success (more probably failure) of how I would try and learn Rust.

Remember, I have not held a side project, with small exceptions, for longer than a month. Perhaps I was feeling some sort of burn out, but I just felt like there was no challenge at all. Rise and repeat, same thing every time. I feel like that passion for development was being revitalized with every reaction or video of ThePrimeagen’s.

## Hello world
I found my old website on archive.org and started looking through all of the snippets I had posted. They were awful and I will share, but I will use these ideas that I had as a teenager to start in rust. The first good idea I came across on the old site was a web server. This is the crap I wrote in 2007, so please judge.

Fucking beautiful, I love it. Now let’s recreate it in Rust.

I opened my favorite editor, I won’t tell you which. I set up all the VScode extensions so that I could start developing. That is when I had my first error, my elegant editor could not find Rust. I have all of my path variables in some shitty file that the Rust installer did not add to, so I had to fix that before having to cmd+p, “reload window” my beautiful, blue and white icon editor. I can see why people dislike this thing, so maybe one day I can move on from it.

Since I thought this shit would be easy, I decided to just start! Since I wanted to really try and do this from scratch, I decided to Chat-GPT “how would you create a socket listener in rust.” Let’s just say, it was way too informative and kinda spoiled the fun. I decided I would just take the first line of the code and try to run with it without looking.

```rust
let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?;
```

Nothing really out of the ordinary here, except for that question mark. Cool, let me ChatGPT that as well.


> The question mark (?) on line 4 is the "try" operator in Rust. It is used to propagate errors from the current function to the caller.
>
> In Rust, functions can return a Result type that represents either a successful result or an error. When a function returns a Result, the caller is responsible for checking whether the result is an Ok value (indicating success) or an Err value (indicating an error).
>
> The "try" operator (?) is a shorthand way to propagate an error up to the caller. It can only be used in functions that return a Result type. If an error occurs within the function, the "try" operator will return the error to the caller immediately, without executing any further code in the function. If the function returns an Ok value, the "try" operator will unwrap the value and return it to the caller.
>
> In the example code I provided, the "try" operator is used to propagate any errors that may occur when binding the TcpListener to the specified address and port. > If an error occurs, the main function will immediately return the error to the caller. If the binding is successful, the code will continue executing normally.


As I read the first line, I realize I am in for something different here. Excited to learn more, I started writing my second line of code, without the help of ChatGPT. I tried using autocomplete to list out all of the available methods from this listener.

![listener autocomplete](https://github.com/timfeid/rust-adventures/blob/master/blog/s01e01/images/autocomplete.png?raw=true)

I could not really figure out which one I was supposed to be using, but I was determined to figure it out. Instead of using autocomplete, I decided to "go to definition" of the TcpListener. This was the moment I realized this will be a lot harder than I thought, but I wanted the full experience, so I am diving in! To my surprise the only thing I was shown when diving in was the following:

```rust
#[stable(feature = "rust1", since = "1.0.0")]
pub struct TcpListener(net_imp::TcpListener);
```

At first I was confused. Where the hell do all of the functions related to the listener live? However, literally right before this definition I found the answer to what I wanted, in a beautifully explained doc comments.

```rust
/// fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
///     let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:80")?;
///
///     // accept connections and process them serially
///     for stream in listener.incoming() {
///         handle_client(stream?);
///     }
///     Ok(())
/// }
```

We're adding a return type of `std::io::Result<()>`, but what the hell is that? My initial thoughts were that this has to do with the question mark from earlier, and that this was potentially a way to tell the compiler that this can error. I needed to do more research to understand this, probably basic, concept. Let's hit ChatGPT again. It basically told me I am stupid and needed to read the previous response. Yup, it was clearly there on the second line.

> In Rust, functions can return a Result type that represents either a successful result or an error. When a function returns a Result, the caller is responsible for checking whether the result is an Ok value (indicating success) or an Err value (indicating an error).

Alright, nice, I think that will stick with me from now on. I definitely grasp the concept. I think. Whatever, let's keep moving.

Right now we have a listener and we are accepting incoming sockets. Let's try and implement the handle_client function. I know we need to read the headers of the request to figure out what we should be serving. I go to the TcpStream source code and the same thing happens. I don't find anything I'm familiar with, coming from TypeScript. However, like before, the comment docs came to the rescue.

```rust
///     stream.read(&mut [0; 128])?;
```

Alright now I'm in somewhat new territory. I remember from my college days that `&` means that it is a reference and I'm assuming `mut` means mutable. ChatGPT confirms. Alright so maybe we make a new variable and pass the reference to read? I give this a go:

```rust
fn handle_client(stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf;
    stream.read(buf);
}
```

To my surprise, it works without buf having a type. What I was not expecting was the following error.

```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `stream` as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable
  --> src/main.rs:15:5
   |
15 |     stream.read(buf);
   |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot borrow as mutable
   |
help: consider changing this to be mutable
   |
13 | fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) {
   |                  +++
```

Is this the "borrow system" thing I've heard so much through the streams and videos I had just watched? Yes. Since I have this concept in my head from previous videos, I ... did what the error told me to.

```rust
fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let buf;
    stream.read(buf);
}
```

New error!
```
error[E0381]: used binding `buf` isn't initialized

14 |     let buf;
   |         --- binding declared here but left uninitialized

   |                 ^^^ `buf` used here but it isn't initialized
   |
help: consider assigning a value
   |
14 |     let buf = todo!();
   |             +++++++++


```

Damn, we actually do need to initialize buf. So, how do I figure out what we should initialize this as? Let's go to the source code. It looks more familiar, but still obviously different from TypeScript.

```rust
impl Read for TcpStream {
    fn read(&mut self, buf: &mut [u8]) -> io::Result<usize> {
        self.0.read(buf)
    }
    // ...
}
```

Alright, now I think we're learning something. `&mut self`, that checks out. I now see why the first error occurred. I also see the buf parameter requires a mutable reference of type `[u8]`. I am already familiar with types and can deduce that `u8` means an unsigned 8-bit integer. Alright let me see if I can figure it out without ChatGPT this time. I added an initial value (array of 1024 0's, of course), which is supposed to be mutable, based on the definition above. I also see that the response type is `io::Result<usize>`. Seems important, and from what I remember earlier, that means this thing can panic, I think? Cool, so how do I get the value of usize instead of result usize? Let's see what ChatGPT says again.

> If you have a Result<usize, SomeError> value and you want to extract the usize value from it, you can use Rust's Result methods, such as unwrap(), expect(), or match.

```rust
let result: Result<usize, SomeError> = some_function();
let value: usize = result.unwrap();
```

```rust
let result: Result<usize, SomeError> = some_function();
let value: usize = match result {
    Ok(v) => v,
    Err(e) => {
        // handle the error here
    }
};
```
> In this example, we use match to match on the Result value. If the value is Ok, we extract the usize value with the v variable. If the value is Err, we can handle > the error in the second arm of the match expression.
>
> Note that it's important to handle errors correctly when working with Result values, as they can represent a failure that needs to be handled.

Pretty straight forward, thanks mr GPT. since I am just testing this, let's do the one that can panic.

```rust
fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buf = [0; 1024];
    let buffer_size: usize = stream.read(&mut buf).unwrap();
}
```



Alright nice, no errors again. I think we've added some data to the buffer. Now how do we transform this array buffer of `u8`s into a string? Google time (yeah, Google, not ChatGPT)! "[convert buffer into a utf8 string rust](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19076719/how-do-i-convert-a-vector-of-bytes-u8-to-a-string)":

```rust
    let buf = &[0x41u8, 0x41u8, 0x42u8];

    let s = match str::from_utf8(buf) {
        Ok(v) => v,
        Err(e) => panic!("Invalid UTF-8 sequence: {}", e),
    };
```

Sweet, we see we have the fancy trycatch let's do it the lazy way instead though? I do want to revisit this match statement at some point.

```rust
fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buf = [0; 1024];
    let buffer_size: usize = stream.read(&mut buf).unwrap();

    let request = str::from_utf8(&buf).unwrap();

    println!("{}", request);
}
```

Nice, no errors!!! Awesome, let's compile it, run it and try to request a page from it.

Sweeeet, I see a request coming in! However, I want to get rid of that warning and actually use the size of the buffer to get only the slice of the buffer that we need. I typed in "how to slice a buffer" to my AI boss and he responded:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut buf = [0; 10]; // create a buffer of 10 elements, initialized to 0
    buf[2] = 1; // set the third element to 1
    buf[5] = 2; // set the sixth element to 2

    let slice = &buf[2..6]; // slice the buffer from the third to the sixth element
    println!("{:?}", slice); // prints "[1, 0, 0, 2]"
}
```

Alright, good start, but I need to use the size as a variable, not a constant i32. Can I just pop this usize variable in and leave the beginning element empty?

```rust
fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) {
    let mut buf = [0; 1024];
    let buffer_size: usize = stream.read(&mut buf).unwrap();

    let request = str::from_utf8(&buf[..buffer_size]).unwrap();

    println!("{}", request);
}
```

Holy crap, it's valid! And it works!

## Conclusion

I am now well over an hour into this thing and I feel like I've learned a lot just by making this work. There is still a lot to learn. I am confident in understanding the code and how it works. However, I am out of time for today.

I am looking forward to seeing what this series leads to in my endevors. I hope to document my findings as best I can so anyone else can follow along and try to learn with me.
